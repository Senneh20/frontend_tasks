# Frontend Task:
   This repository provides solution to the task that aimed at frontend implementation to fetch the list of tasks from a server, allow users to check or uncheck these tasks and update the state in the server.

## Details
### Solution to Task 1   
- I created a function to find an html element 'todo-item' and wrapped it around the JavaScript Promise. 
- The function would return a Promise that resolves once all of the elements were successfully added to the body element. - If the Nodelist is empty and nothing to loop over, the Promise would reject and a statement would be logged to the console.
